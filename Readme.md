## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

SmartGuard is an intelligent network monitoring system designed to help parents understand and guide their teenagers' internet usage through AI-powered content analysis. Unlike traditional parental controls that simply block content, SmartGuard provides contextual understanding - distinguishing between a teenager researching "drugs" for a school health project versus visiting actual drug-related websites.

### The Problem We're Solving

- **Context-blind filtering**: Traditional parental controls can't distinguish educational content from inappropriate material
- **False positives overload**: Parents get overwhelmed with alerts about harmless content  
- **Easy circumvention**: Tech-savvy teenagers easily bypass simple keyword-based filters
- **Lack of family insight**: No visibility into healthy vs. concerning digital behavior patterns
- **All-or-nothing approach**: Current solutions are either too restrictive or too permissive
